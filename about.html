                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                      <p>Everything started with a dream. Rucker's was founded in 1975 by 
                         Roderick Rucker, he wanted to combine the arizona view with the perfect
                         italian wine and so when he was 15 years old he started working as a bass boy at 
                         Giorgio's House, it is there where he understood the joy of making people happy 
                         and thats when the idea of Rucker's. Later on his 25's he was broke and unemployed decided
                         to go give his last hope of having his own restaurant, so he worked double shifts at Giorgio's 
                         even to work on a car wash on the weekends, finally close to his 50's he save up enough money 
                         to open his own restaurant. Rucker's was well trust by locals and the rest is history.</p>
